    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem is one of the earliest inference algorithm. Bayes Theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening (e.g. a message being spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events (e.g. the appearance of certain words in a message).\n",

    "Example: Brenda and Alex are employees at the office. We know that:\n",
    " * Alex works mostly in the office, 3 times a week\n",
    " * Brenda mainly travels, so she comes to the office once a week\n",
    "NOTE: a week is made of 5 working days\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe someone running through the office wearing a red sweather, but we're unable to recognise who she/he is. So, we make a guess. Based on the above data, we calculate the single probabilities of the single events:\n",
