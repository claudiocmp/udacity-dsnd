    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000$, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The models picked are classifiers, as regressors are not suitable for predicting a bunch of zeros and ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Application example:** As previously discussed in the course, a spam classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stengths:** Taking into account a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weaknesses:** The algorithm is 'naive' in the sense of assuming that all the features are independent of each other - i.e. there is no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **suitability:** Albeit this problem does not have a very large number of features, it would be interesting to see a result by considering the features independent to each other. I do not expect this to be the most effective algorithm, but still to perform within suitable terms. This algorithm might tend to underfit, if compared to the other two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensamble Method (AdaBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Application example:** Adaboost is best used on binary classifications problems. Viola-Jones framework shows a possible application in face detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stengths:** As a decision tree based algorithm, AdaBoost is designed to avoid overfitting, which is typical of decision trees. Moreover, early termination can play a significant performance role in the case of a skewed dataset (y has more negative samples than positive ones) [Viola-Jones (cascade architecture paragraph)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weaknesses:** Require much data to successfully avoid overfit. This lead to high computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **suitability:** Compared with other ensamble methods such as bagging and random forest, Adaboost should perform well in weighting hard the mistakes it makes. The number of samples make me thinking of a suitable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Application example:** Extremely non-linear pattern detections benefit from this algorithm [examples](https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/). I found Protein fold and remote homology detection mostly interesting for their nature of showing an emergence behaviour of a complex system (typical in nature).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stengths:** Can easily recognise and be adapted to high-degree patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weaknesses:** This algorithm has the tendency to overfit and requires long computation time.  Many parameters to be considered, so fine tuning might be hard (kernel, C/gamma, degree, learning_rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **suitability:** SVM should fit the data quite precisely - however, the problems will come on the test set. The thing is, that people might have very different backgrounds, but still come up with reasonable incomes (at least, this is the US, the land of opportunities!). This algorithm might tend to overfit, when compared with the other two.\n"

    "**Answer:** To select one out of the three candidate models, we must look at 1) metrics, 2) computation time and 3) how the algorithm suits the data we have. Firstly, two evaluation criteria (metrics) are picked: Accuracy and F-score. We then create a naive classifier - i.e. a classifier with no intelligence: it evaluates every possible record as \"suitable for donation\", thus with an income higher than \\$50K. Then, we evaluate the naive classifier to set a lower bound for the two metrics (dashed black line in the charts). These are:\n",
    "* Accuracy: 0.2478\n",
    "* F-score: 0.2917\n",
    "\n",
    "All the classifiers report metrics above this lower bound, however GaussianNB (A) performs poorly (half to 2/3) if compared to AdaBoost(B) and SVM(C). Moreover, the latter is more sensitive to the size of the data sample, albeit performing great in terms of computation time. On the other hand, B has higher computation cost - 20 times slower than A -, but the best results with metrics; the computation cost itself, however, is still reasonable as it is in the order od seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "C is the worst at computation cost (68 times B and 1300 times A), while returning good results in metrics. Such results, however, are not as good as B. Further improvements might demostrate C better than B, but will require more time (and cost), due to more parameters to tune and longer machine time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, B demonstrate also a narrower difference between metrics on the training and test sets. This suggest a better behaviour of B against overfitting. This might be due to the model's natural tendency to behave well against datasets with higher percentage of 'negative' labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the best model to move forward or fine tuning is B - the AdaBoost classifier."

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.

    "**Answer:** AdaBoost is an ensamble of many instances of the same type of model, trained to limit their own weaknesses. More specifically, a series of the same model (say 20 equally mediocre students) is repeatdly trained where each one considers the error the previous one made one step earlier (each student studies looking at his/her previous friend's mistakes).\n",

We can say that each model is associated with a weight, which is positive if the model gives good answer, negative if the model returns wrong answers, and is zero if the model is unpredictable. The final ensamble of weak models (the mediocre students) is a stronger model, the AdaBoost classifier. Once deployed, the strong model will make predictions by consulting each weak model, but giving them a weight as much as we learnt these models were effective in the evaluation process."

Here, accuracy improves slightly (0.9%), whereas F-score improve more (2.3%). This might suggest that the optimized model gets better overall, with a stronger consolidation on precision and recall, rather than overall accuracy. The F-beta scorer with a value `beta=0.5` suggest that such improvement might have happened on the precision side - but further investigation is required (e.g. plotting out the actual metrics). \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** Feature selection mostly affects the F-score (-3.5%). For the specificity of the problem, I would rather raise the question to the client if they consider acceptable a lower efficiency of their fund campaign. To do so, I should rather compare the results and see where the mistake is. Unfortunately, the data does not tell if >50K means 51K or 150K. Therefore, it is not possible, given this data, to predict where such loss is going to be. On the other hand, with that information available, it could have been possible to investigate if that -3.5% accuracy affects those people in the \"very gray area\" therefore people that might have not been keen to donate. But this goes beyond to the data available, as I am making the assumption that wealthier people are keener to donate (which might not be true)."
