## Concepts of Experiment Design

**An experiment** is defined by comparing outcomes between two or more groups, and ensuring equivalence between the  compared groups *except* for the manipulation that we want to test - the *unit of analysis*. 

When there is no control group, it is not an experiment, but an **observational study** (we cannot infer causality). 

Mixed-control situations are **quasi-experiment**: behavior of the population pre-change and post-change are compared, to make judgment on the effects of the change 



**Types of experiment**

* between-subjects: it is a A/B test where participants are split between two groups
* Within-subject:  it is a A/B test where participants are conducted through both groups in a row (first A, then B or vice-versa)

NOTE: A=control, B=experimental



**Sampling**

* **Simple random sampling** each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected 
* **Stratified random sampling** is simple random sampling applied to population *disjoint groups* (or strata), with a sampling number equal to their share in the population. like gender, (e.g. male, female, other) or age (e.g. 18-25, 26-35, etc.)
* **Non-Probabilistic Sampling** is made of a *convenience sample* records information from readily available units. Studies performed in the social sciences at colleges (sample: students) often fall into this kind of sampling. 



**How to measure outcomes**

The goals of your study may not be the same as the way you evaluate the study's success. We use **evaluation metrics**, designed on how the *implications* of the metric matters relatively to the goal.

Vocabulary: "key results" (KRs) or "key performance indicators" (KPIs) as ways of measuring progress against quarterly or annual "objectives".



**Validity**

* **Construct**: evaluation (metrics) and objective are aligned, and not ill-constructed.
* **Internal**: causality is correctly interpreted, and there aren't variables external to the experiment which affect the result.
* **External**



**Common pitfalls**

* Biases
  * **Sampling bias**
  * **Novelty bias**
  * **Other biases**
  * **Experimenter**
